# DWT-CNN

# Convolutional Neural Networks with DWT 

This is a MatLab implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks for the task of classification 
two classes (Recaptured Images and Original Images), as described in our paper:
 
Preeti Mehta, Mahesh K Singh, Nitin Singha [Near-duplicate Image Detection Based on Wavelet Decomposition with Modified Deep Learning Model]

## Installation

MATLAB 2018a or higher version

## Requirements
* Deep Learing Toolbox
* Wavelet Toolbox
* Image Processing Toolbox

## Run the demo
CNN_main.m


## Data

In order to use your own data, you have to provide 
* an N by N images
Have a look at the `preprocessingLayer.m` file.
